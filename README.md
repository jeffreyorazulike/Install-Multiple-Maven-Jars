# Install-Multiple-Maven-Jars

I want this program to be open sourced so that maybe any other exprienced 
Java Dev can brush up some parts of the program and i also plan to make the 
program a GUI in a future commit, however, it still remains a property of
Jeffrey Orazulike(me) and should not be used in commercial apps without my
permission, if you find any bug or any part of the program you think can be
changed for the better, send me a message

To run this program all the jar files should be in a folder that specifies the group id
like you see in the VS Code screenshot, for example all the jar files from 
the group id (org.apache.maven.plugins) should be stored in a folder with the same name
and that folder should be stored in the maven repos folder where the InstallMavenJars.java 
file is, there can be more than one group id in the maven repos folder and also make sure
the entire program with the maven repos folder and java file is stored in this kind of 
folder hierachy \jeffreyorazulike\installmavenjars
